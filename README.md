## Project Description

Are the flights from low-cost airlines delay more? Cheap airlines working with tighter timeline, they turnaround time is significantly less compared to the higher ranked companies. In my analysis I went behind to this assumption to see whether it's true.

**Hypothesis:** The economic airlines delay more.


## Methodology

In my analysis I used data for all Europen flights arriving to any of the German airport between 1st June 2020 and 31st August 2020. This dataset contains about 111.000 data points.
